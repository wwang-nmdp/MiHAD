The MiHAD is an immunoinformatics database of minor histocompatibility antigens. It includes comprehensive information about experimentally validated MiHAs and also includes the predicted MiHAs. Initially, we developed a pipeline to extract the differential missense mutations from 205 donor-recipient paired whole genome sequencing data, then predicted their binding affinity with HLA molecules.
